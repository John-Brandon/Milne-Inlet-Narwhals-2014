# Purpose : Code to table Milne Inlet narwhal data for LGL / Baffinland 
#  Notes : These routines work on data that has already been extracted and munged, so the first step is to load that pre-massaged data 
#  1) Your main directory will differ. See 'base.dir' variable below to edit that path to match your system
#  2) POSIXlt is a class for representing calendar dates and times (in decreasing order to be unambiguous, i.e. "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS")
#  3) These data are also known as "Relative Abundance and Distribution" (RAD) data
